      "content": "<p>It&#8217;s been a while since I&#8217;ve posted here &#8211; life has been pretty busy these past few months, so here&#8217;s quick post to get back into the swing of things!</p>\n<p>In my new role, I work primarily with Shopify. The most tedious part for me was creating the schema within each template. I&#8217;d often find myself accidentally missing a comma, quotation mark, or generally entering invalid JSON &#8211; so I created a few useful <a href=\"https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/userdefinedsnippets\">User Snippets</a> for VS Code to automatically insert valid Shopify schema into my editor.</p>\n<p>User Snippets are a great way to speed up development, they&#8217;re pretty much your own custom <a href=\"https://emmet.io/\">emmet</a> (if you&#8217;re not using emmet, what are you doing?!)</p>\n<p>You can create a new User Snippet file in VS Code by going to Code &gt; Preferences &gt; User Snippets (File &gt; Preferences &gt; User Snippets on Windows). In my case, I already had the <a href=\"https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=neilding.language-liquid\">Liquid Languages Support</a> extension for VS Code installed, so once you hit your User Snippets, select <strong>Liquid </strong>to add snippets just for Liquid files.</p>\n<p>The User Snippet file is a JSON file itself, so all the snippets below should be wrapped within <code>{ }</code></p>\n<h2>Basic Schema</h2>\n<p>Inserts a base schema tag with a a basic header setting when you type <code>schema + tab</code></p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-json\">\"Basic Schema\": {\r\n    \"prefix\": \"schema\",\r\n    \"body\": [\r\n        \"{% schema %}\"\r\n        \"{\"\r\n        \"    \\\"name\\\": \\\"Name\\\",\"\r\n        \"    \\\"settings\\\": [\"\r\n        \"        {\"\r\n        \"            \\\"type\\\": \\\"header\\\",\"\r\n        \"            \\\"content\\\": \\\"Description\\\"\"\r\n        \"        }\"\r\n        \"    ]\"\r\n        \"}\"\r\n        \"{% endschema %}\"\r\n    ],\r\n    \"description\": \"Liquid Schema Blocks\"\r\n},</code></pre>\n<h2>Single Schema Item</h2>\n<p>Useful for quickly creating items within your existing schema by typing <code>schemaitem + tab</code> into your editor.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-json\">\"Schema Item\": {\r\n    \"prefix\": \"schemaitem\",\r\n    \"body\": [\r\n        \"{\"\r\n        \"    \\\"type\\\": \\\"text\\\",\"\r\n        \"    \\\"id\\\": \\\"id\\\",\"\r\n        \"    \\\"label\\\": \\\"label\\\"\"\r\n        \"},\"\r\n    ],\r\n    \"description\": \"Individual schema item\"\r\n},</code></pre>\n<h2>Schema Blocks</h2>\n<p>Inserts schema blocks into your editor by entering <code>schemablocks + tab</code></p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-json\">\"Schema Blocks\": {\r\n    \"prefix\": \"schemablocks\",\r\n    \"body\": [\r\n        \"{% schema %}\"\r\n        \"{\"\r\n        \"    \\\"name\\\":\\\"Blocks\\\",\"\r\n        \"    \\\"blocks\\\":[\"\r\n        \"         {\"\r\n        \"            \\\"type\\\": \\\"handle\\\",\"\r\n        \"            \\\"name\\\": \\\"name\\\",\"\r\n        \"            \\\"settings\\\":[\"\r\n        \"                {\"\r\n        \"                    \\\"type\\\": \\\"text\\\",\"\r\n        \"                    \\\"id\\\": \\\"text\\\",\"\r\n        \"                    \\\"label\\\": \\\"Label\\\"\"\r\n        \"                }\"\r\n        \"            ]\"\r\n        \"        }\"\r\n        \"    ]\"\r\n        \"}\"\r\n        \"{% endschema %}\"\r\n    ],\r\n    \"description\": \"Liquid Schema Blocks\"\r\n},</code></pre>\n<p>That&#8217;s it! I&#8217;m going to create even more that I think will be useful for settings I frequently use, including block settings (without the entire schema template), select, radio buttons etc.</p>\n",

      "slug": "now-playing-screen-spotify-raspberry-pi-es6",
      "content": "<p>Two things that I&#8217;ve wanted to do for a while was to have a cool Raspberry Pi project and to play with the Spotify API. So why not combine them both? I&#8217;m pretty sure this has been done 1000 times before, but sometimes it&#8217;s fun to build things from scratch, y&#8217;know?</p>\n<p>This post will be a brief outlining of the process (with a link to it&#8217;s GitHub at the bottom).</p>\n<p>Things used:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://thepihut.com/products/raspberry-pi-3-model-b?variant=1138129768&amp;gclid=Cj0KCQjwxN_XBRCFARIsAIufy1bwwMxgmopTS4xhGC2BrgEmtPc7Ge9_UbvV4JvXGwfn1Ag2xuI-ECwaAvhmEALw_wcB#fo_c=1889&amp;fo_k=64d70113b00b47cadf22c5003eec96ab&amp;fo_s=gplauk\">Raspberry Pi Model B</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.waveshare.com/wiki/7inch_HDMI_LCD_(C)#Working_with_Raspberry_Pi\">Waveshare 7 Inch LCD Touchscreen</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B071CLBM5J/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o01_s00?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1\">Miniature Easel</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://beta.developer.spotify.com/dashboard/\">Spotify API</a></li>\n<li>6&#215;4 Photo Frame (From Paper Chase)</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Hardware</h2>\n<p>Buying the screen was by far the most difficult part of this project simply because there&#8217;s such a mixed bag of reviews and products out there. The Pi community seems to mostly favour screens below 3.5 inches, so solid reviews for any (touch) screens above 5 inches were far and few between. I think I ended up scouring through threads on <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/\">/r/raspberry_pi</a> before landing on the Waveshare screen.</p>\n<p>The screen didn&#8217;t immediately work with the Pi, which is normal. I had to connect a spare 22&#8242; monitor and edit <code>/boot/config.txt</code> to allow the Waveshare screen to both display and respond to touch events (instructions are on the Waveshare link above).</p>\n<p>So far, the screen has held up well. The colour and clarity is great for its price range and touch is fairly responsive, though does take some time to calibrate. Would definitely recommend!</p>\n<p>I&#8217;m running this on a Raspberry Pi with <a href=\"https://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/raspbian/\">Raspbian</a> installed. Nothing really worth mentioning here!</p>\n<h2>Building the app</h2>\n<p>This was actually really fun to make for two reasons:</p>\n<h3>Spotify API<strong><br />\n</strong></h3>\n<p>The API for Spotify is genuinely a pleasure to use, it supplies a surprising amount of endpoints. The endpoint that I&#8217;m using to capture Spotify&#8217;s state is <a href=\"https://beta.developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/reference/player/get-the-users-currently-playing-track/\">user-read-currently-playing</a>.</p>\n<p>I opted against using one of the many wrappers that Spotify recommend because I wanted to learn the process from start to finish (even though it would have been quicker to use a wrapper). Unsurprisingly, the most difficult part was the OAuth flow.</p>\n<p>Another fun issue I faced was making it as real-time as possible. The API includes an <code>is_playing</code> parameter which returns either true or false &#8211; so on initial load, the app grabs the data from Spotify with <code>fetch</code> and stores the unique track ID in <code>localStorage</code>. Then <code>setInterval</code> is used to fetch data every 3.8 seconds, where the track ID from Spotify is compared to the locally stored track ID, and the page is only refreshed if they&#8217;re different.</p>\n<p>To be honest, I&#8217;m not overly thrilled with polling the server every 3.8 seconds, but without WebSockets, this is the cleanest solution I came up with. Maybe down the line I&#8217;ll venture into WebSockets, but for now I&#8217;ll just keep on eye on the rate limiting.</p>\n<h3>ES6</h3>\n<p>So this project was really my first exposure to an ES6 project, which is another reason why I didn&#8217;t want to use a wrapper. I actually originally wrote the whole thing in ES5, and then rewrote it entirely in ES6. I&#8217;ll be the first to say that the code isn&#8217;t perfect, but as a whole, I&#8217;m very proud of it for being my first full ES6 driven project.</p>\n<h3>Front end</h3>\n<p>The Raspberry Pi can be a powerful device, but I became very aware of its hardware limitations. Originally, I had captured a gradient of colours from the artwork and animated them using CSS in a water-like state. When the track would change, as would the gradient &#8211; but that was pretty laggy. Luckily, there&#8217;s the useful <a href=\"https://github.com/akfish/node-vibrant\">node-vibrant</a> package (also used in the footer below) &#8211; which will grab a dominant colour and apply it as the background.</p>\n<h2>Connecting the two</h2>\n<p>At this point, I realised I had to connect the monitor and photo frame. The frame took ages to find, because there wouldn&#8217;t be an off-the-shelf photo frame that would perfectly fit the 16:9 monitor. I specifically wanted a frame that included a border so that the edges of the monitor would be hidden from sight. As is, the frame <em>slightly</em> crops the monitor, but I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s too much of a sacrifice.</p>\n<p>Now, arts &amp; crafts is totally not my thing, so the monitor is literally taped to the back of the frame. It&#8217;s really, really not pretty, but hey &#8211; nobody is gonna be looking at the back of this thing.</p>\n<p>Something I totally didn&#8217;t take into consideration is that the depth of a Pi mounted to a screen, mounted to a photo frame is bigger than I expected.. so any expectations of hanging this on the wall went out of the window &#8211; luckily, the idea of buying a novelty easel came into my head &#8211; I&#8217;m actually happier with that aesthetic than if it was on the wall.</p>\n<p>I really wanted this to be a &#8216;set it and forget it&#8217; scenario &#8211; and it is. all I have to do is power up the Pi and Raspbian will immediately open Chromium in kiosk mode. I was able to do this by SSHing into the Pi and editing the startup configuration file:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-bash\">sudo nano /home/pi/.config/lxsession/LXDE-pi/autostart</code></pre>\n<p>Entering some settings to auto-boot to Chromium&#8230;.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-bash\">@xset s off # disable the screensaver\r\n@xset -dpms # disable energy saving features\r\n@xset s noblank # ensure screen doesn't go blank\r\n@chromium-browser --kiosk https://*YOUR-URL-HERE* # open up chromium to specific web page</code></pre>\n<p>The neat thing about Chromium is that you can boot it with flags, <code>--kiosk</code> will boot Chromium without the address bar. It turns out that there are a <a href=\"https://peter.sh/experiments/chromium-command-line-switches/\">shit load of flags</a> that I want to play with (remote debugging caught my eye).</p>\n<p>I just have turn on the Pi, press the &#8216;Connect with Spotify&#8217; button, and away we go!</p>\n<h2>To conclude</h2>\n<p>Overall, I am <strong>very </strong>happy with how this turned out. I&#8217;m happy with the code, the frame I found was near perfect &#8211; and this was just a fun little project to that I enjoyed doing. Things just seemed to work out well and now I have this nice little digital photo frame visualising the music around me. I do definitely want to explore the Spotify API some more and see what more data I can dive into.</p>\n<p>The one thing I do really like about this setup is that if I ever get bored of having &#8216;Now Playing&#8217;, I can just build something new to display on this screen&#8230;</p>\n<p><strong>Use it:</strong><br />\n<a href=\"https://jonashcroft.co.uk/nowify\">https://jonashcroft.co.uk/nowify</a></p>\n<p><strong>GitHub:</strong><br />\n<a href=\"https://github.com/jonashcroft/Nowify\">https://github.com/jonashcroft/Nowify</a></p>\n",

      "slug": "how-to-display-your-most-recent-last-fm-track-with-php",
      "content": "<p>You may have noticed that in the footer of this website, the album artwork of my most recent track is displayed. This will be a short post about how you can do the same.</p>\n<p>There are two requirements here:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>last.fm account (<a href=\"https://www.last.fm/join\">create one</a>)</li>\n<li>API keys (<a href=\"https://www.last.fm/api/account/create\">generate some</a>)</li>\n</ol>\n<p>This is actually a simple cURL request, and since the last.fm endpoint returns data in JSON format, we can easily manipulate the data. So once you&#8217;ve got your API keys, we&#8217;ll be making a simple cURL request:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-php\">    $user     = '** USERNAME **'; // Enter your username here\r\n    $key      = '** API KEYS **'; // Enter your API Key\r\n    $status   = 'Last Played:'; // default to this, if 'Now Playing' is true, the json will reflect this.\r\n    $endpoint = 'https://ws.audioscrobbler.com/2.0/?method=user.getrecenttracks&amp;user=' . $user . '&amp;&amp;limit=2&amp;api_key=' . $key . '&amp;format=json';\r\n    $ch = curl_init();\r\n    curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_URL, $endpoint);\r\n    curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_USERAGENT, $_SERVER['HTTP_USER_AGENT']);\r\n    curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_RETURNTRANSFER, 1);\r\n    curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_SSL_VERIFYPEER, 0);\r\n    curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_HTTPAUTH, CURLAUTH_BASIC);\r\n    curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_CONNECTTIMEOUT, 0); // 0 for indefinite\r\n    curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_TIMEOUT, 10); // 10 second attempt before timing out\r\n    curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_HTTPHEADER, array('Accept: application/json'));\r\n    $response = curl_exec($ch);\r\n    $lastfm[] = json_decode($response, true);\r\n    curl_close($ch);</code></pre>\n<p>All we&#8217;re doing here is accessing the last.fm API at <code>https://ws.audioscrobbler.com/2.0/?</code>, using the <code>getrecenttracks</code> endpoint (<a href=\"https://www.last.fm/api\">full list of endpoints</a>) with our username and API keys for authentication.</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s worth noting at this point that for some reason the last.fm API requires a minimum of 2 tracks. If we wanted, we could change <code>limit=2</code> to a higher number and display a few tracks.</p>\n<p>We can now var_dump the <code>$lastfm</code> array and see all of the information that last.fm has on our last two tracks. This will include track name, artist, album, artwork, last.fm URL etc.</p>\n<p>We&#8217;re going to grab the album artwork first. Since there&#8217;s multiple elements in our array, we <em>could</em> loop over the 2 tracks and grab the first one &#8211; or we can follow the tree and define our variable like so:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-php\">$artwork = $lastfm[0]['recenttracks']['track'][0]['image'][2]['#text'];</code></pre>\n<p><b>Note:</b> last.fm will return artwork in 4 image sizes (small, medium, large &amp; extra large) &#8211; in the above example, the <code>[2]</code> signifies that we&#8217;re grabbing the &#8216;large&#8217; size. So change this as you please.</p>\n<p>So now, if we  var_dump <code>$artwork</code> &#8211; we get the full URL of the image from last.fm. Great! Next, we&#8217;re going to grab the other information we want and push that into a new array:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-php\">$artwork = $lastfm[0]['recenttracks']['track'][0]['image'][2]['#text'];\r\n\r\nif ( empty( $artwork ) ) {  // Check if album artwork exists on last.fm, else use our own fallback image\r\n    $artwork = 'img/artwork-fallback.png';\r\n}\r\n\r\n$trackInfo = [\r\n    'name'       =&gt; $lastfm[0]['recenttracks']['track'][0]['name'],\r\n    'artist'     =&gt; $lastfm[0]['recenttracks']['track'][0]['artist']['#text'],\r\n    'link'       =&gt; $lastfm[0]['recenttracks']['track'][0]['url'],\r\n    'albumArt'   =&gt; $artwork,\r\n    'status'     =&gt; $status\r\n];</code></pre>\n<p>In the above, we are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Checking that album artwork exists using <a href=\"http://php.net/manual/en/function.empty.php\">empty()</a>, and if not &#8211; loading our own fallback image</li>\n<li>Grabbing track name, artist name, artwork, last.fm link</li>\n<li>Adding our <code>$status</code> variable &#8211; the &#8216;Last Played&#8217; text from the cURL code snippet above.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>At this point, all of our track information is accessible via the <code>$trackInfo</code> array. To access each element individually, we can do this:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-php\">echo $trackInfo['name']; // Display track name\r\necho $trackInfo['artist']; // Display artist name\r\necho $trackInfo['link']; // Display last.fm song link\r\necho $trackInfo['albumArt']; // Display artwork image URL </code></pre>\n<p>From here, you could simply display this data with HTML and be done. But I&#8217;m going to extend this by checking if the track is currently playing and pushing that to our array, while changing <code>$status</code> to reflect this:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-php\">if ( !empty($lastfm[0]['recenttracks']['track'][0]['@attr']['nowplaying']) ) {\r\n    $trackInfo['nowPlaying'] = $lastfm[0]['recenttracks']['track'][0]['@attr']['nowplaying'];\r\n    $trackInfo['status'] = 'Now Playing:';\r\n}</code></pre>\n<p>If a track is currently being scrobbled to last.fm, the API response will add <code>[nowplaying] =&gt; true</code> to the response. This means that it&#8217;s safe to assume that &#8216;if this exists, then the track is currently playing&#8217;.</p>\n<p>And that&#8217;s it! At a bare minimum, you can display the array elements in <code>img</code> and <code>p</code> tags however you&#8217;d like.</p>\n<p>What I&#8217;ve done on my site is place the cURL request and array creation in its own function, which passes the <code>$trackInfo</code> array to a secondary function that displays the formatted data. The end result of that is what you see in the footer.</p>\n<p>The last.fm API is quite fun to play with &#8211; I&#8217;d recommend taking a full look at the endpoints and seeing what you can come up with.</p>\n<p>You can view the <a href=\"https://github.com/jonashcroft/last-fm-now-playing\">full code on my GitHub</a>.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n",

      "slug": "one-month-with-monzo-the-digital-bank",
      "content": "<p>For the past year or so I&#8217;ve been rapidly switching current accounts to reap the rewards of the switch incentives, and in November 2017 I was recommended <a href=\"https://www.youandb.co.uk\">B Money</a>, who promote themselves as &#8216;digital banking&#8217; (and were offering a £250 switch reward). It was an instant yes from me because I&#8217;ve learned through switching just how awful many banks digital services are.</p>\n<p>B Money was a refreshing take on banking: their branding is bold, their app allows you to monitor spending habits in real-time, set-up saving pots in a way that isn&#8217;t dreadful &#8211; and I <em>do</em> like<em> </em>B Money, but for me the app just didn&#8217;t feel ready for prime-time. It would often glitch out &amp; freeze &#8211; not very reassuring when it comes to a system that&#8217;s handling your money.</p>\n<p>Which leads me to <a href=\"https://monzo.com\">Monzo</a>. I actually signed up to the prepaid card BETA when it was Mondo in 2016, but never got around to actually getting a card. Given my frustrations with B Money, I decided that now was the time to make Monzo my main current account.</p>\n<p>I requested my card from Monzo and it arrived the next day, which was amazing. Something that I didn&#8217;t realise up until writing this was that it also didn&#8217;t come with stacks of wasteful promotional and legal booklets. Similarly, your PIN is instantly supplied to you when you log in to the app, Even better! It&#8217;s worth noting that the physical card doesn&#8217;t have your account number and sort code printed onto the card, these are displayed under the &#8216;Account&#8217; section of the app, which I think is a nice touch for security.</p>\n<p>A lot of users that I&#8217;ve spoken to have initially kept their &#8216;main&#8217; bank account open and transferred money to Monzo as and when they need it &#8211; and I do understand the rationale here, as I think that there is some form of uncertainty when it comes to Monzo because it&#8217;s a &#8216;new&#8217; bank that isn&#8217;t piggy-backing off of an established bank, but I wanted to go all-in with Monzo to really see if it can stand tall as a primary current account. So how did it fare?</p>\n<p>First and foremost &#8211; the app itself is gorgeous. The design is modern and sleek without compromising on usability. In an age where your digital presence can make or break you &#8211; Monzo has the advantage of being able to build it&#8217;s digital infrastructure with modern technology in mind, whereas I feel like more traditional banks have had to hack their often outdated infrastructure to be more up-to-date.</p>\n<p>When you spend, you&#8217;ll be notified instantly, and though spending notifications aren&#8217;t a new thing &#8211; it&#8217;s nice to keep the paper-trail contained within the native app, rather than cross referencing SMS with bank statements. Also, as somebody who&#8217;s guilty of not checking their balance often enough, these notifications will keep a running tab on your daily spend for the day.</p>\n<p>One thing that I especially like in regards to the spending notifications is that you&#8217;ll get shown when a failed payment occurs, which I discovered accidentally:</p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_572\" style=\"width: 1024px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img class=\"wp-image-572 size-large\" src=\"https://jonashcroft.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/New-Note-copy-1024x748.jpg\" alt=\"Notification from the Monzo app of a failed transaction.\" width=\"1024\" height=\"748\" srcset=\"https://jonashcroft.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/New-Note-copy-1024x748.jpg 1024w, https://jonashcroft.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/New-Note-copy-300x219.jpg 300w, https://jonashcroft.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/New-Note-copy-768x561.jpg 768w, https://jonashcroft.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/New-Note-copy-992x725.jpg 992w, https://jonashcroft.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/New-Note-copy-250x183.jpg 250w, https://jonashcroft.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/New-Note-copy-480x351.jpg 480w, https://jonashcroft.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/New-Note-copy.jpg 1125w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">Notification from the Monzo app of a failed transaction.</figcaption></figure>\n<p>I hit a bit of a snag when I first used a cashpoint: I was out in London and withdrew £10 &#8211; I checked the app and saw 3 transactions: 2 instances of &#8216;£10 withdrawn&#8217; and 1 instance of &#8216;£10 deposit&#8217;. Not wanting to phone up a call centre and be on hold for 25 minutes for a 5 minute conversation, I hit up the in-app online support. I think I literally wrote this out while I was on the train and received a reply shortly after &#8211; this wasn&#8217;t necessarily an urgent issue, so it was nice to get on with things and reply at my own pace.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_576\" style=\"width: 677px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img class=\"wp-image-576 size-full\" src=\"https://jonashcroft.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/IMG_6378.png\" alt=\"Screenshot of a conversation between me and Monzo support.\" width=\"677\" height=\"499\" srcset=\"https://jonashcroft.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/IMG_6378.png 677w, https://jonashcroft.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/IMG_6378-300x221.png 300w, https://jonashcroft.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/IMG_6378-250x184.png 250w, https://jonashcroft.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/IMG_6378-480x354.png 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 677px) 100vw, 677px\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">Screenshot of a conversation between me and Monzo support.</figcaption></figure>\n<p>It turned out that the issue was with a delay on the merchant finalising the transaction, but as you&#8217;d expect, the response from support was clear and simple to understand. If it was an urgent issue, phone support would definitely be more ideal (as of writing this, I&#8217;m not sure if Monzo have phone support), but for minor issues like this, online support is great.</p>\n<p>I do however feel like Monzo are guilty of overusing emoji to seem more relatable&#8230; 🙈 🤙</p>\n<p>The elephant in the room with Monzo is the lack of Apple Pay. Since I first got Apple Pay, I&#8217;ve very rarely used my physical card, so I was a bit annoyed that Monzo didn&#8217;t have this already, especially when some of their competitors do. I&#8217;ve read online that a lot of people consider this a dealbreaker, and I do empathise. Once you go Apple Pay, it really is an inconvenience to have to go into your wallet and get your card out. Realistically, though: this is a first-world problem and for me personally, the rest of the benefits of Monzo outweigh the inconvenience of no Apple Pay.</p>\n<p>The features are incredibly useful. The app has a line-graph of your spending above your transactions, which are then broken down into predefined categories like &#8216;Shopping&#8217;, &#8216;Eating Out&#8217;, &#8216;Bills&#8217; etc. I would personally like to see more specific categories, or even the option for custom categories, too.</p>\n<p>You can also set up &#8216;Saving Pots&#8217; &#8211; which is a separate Savings Account, allowing you to have piggy banks for specific saving goals. I love the idea of this &#8211; I prefer to split up my savings into different categories. As of right now though, I haven&#8217;t set these up because I don&#8217;t think that there&#8217;s any interest earned on these savings. So for now, my savings are kept in a separate bank account, but I&#8217;ll definitely keep an eye on this.</p>\n<p>Overall, my first month with Monzo has gone incredibly well. They&#8217;ve earned the loyalty of a serial-switcher through their ethics, <a href=\"https://trello.com/b/9tcaMB4w/monzo-transparent-product-roadmap\">transparent roadmap</a> and outstanding digital services. In hindsight, I&#8217;m not really sure why I was expecting a catastrophic failure, but I suppose that skepticism of a new bank is healthy. I do think that Monzo has an incredibly bright future, I think they&#8217;re going to bring some good innovation to an industry that is in desperate need of it. I&#8217;m looking forward to seeing where the next 12 months with Monzo goes.</p>\n",

The other fallback, is that if you want to monitor changes, you&#8217;ll have to manually reload the file every time you want to catch an error.</p>\n<p>This is where the the Terminal comes into play. If you open up Terminal, and enter:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-bash\">tail -f /path/to/wp-content/debug.log</code></pre>\n<p>This will open up your log file and will automatically update so that <strong>you can monitor your PHP errors in real-time</strong>. I&#8217;ve found this to be indispensable for productivity, usually having the Terminal on one screen, and the code/front-end on the other.</p>\n<p>I&#8217;m 100% sure that there are ways to extend this further (for example, with xDebug), but I thought I&#8217;d share this quick little tip.</p>\n",

      "slug": "a-guide-to-setting-up-retroarch-on-the-amazon-fire-tv",
      "content": "<p>Something that I’ve been meaning to do for the longest time was to set up a TV based retro gaming emulator – and it turns out that the Amazon Fire TV is a great device for doing this.</p>\n<p>I think that in an ideal world, this would probably have been done on a Raspberry Pi with RetroPie &#8211; but currently plugged into our TV is a Chromecast, Now TV Box, and an Amazon Fire TV. I didn&#8217;t really want to add a fourth device to the mix, so to keep things central, I&#8217;ve opted to emulate on the Amazon Fire TV.</p>\n<p>When setting this up &#8211; I noticed that there were many tutorials out there for this, but I couldn&#8217;t find a specific guide for setting all of this up on an Amazon Fire TV<strong>. </strong>Most of the tutorials were PC based, so I wanted to write a guide for those out there who want to set up retro gaming on the Fire TV.</p>\n<p>What you&#8217;ll need:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B06XTWLSRF/\">Amazon Fire TV</a> with Kodi installed *</li>\n<li>Games Controller</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/zach-morris/plugin.program.iarl\">The Internet Archive ROM Launcher</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.retroarch.com/\">RetroArch</a></li>\n<li>Patience</li>\n</ul>\n<p><em>*  I&#8217;ve used the Gen 2 box, Gen 3 should be the same &#8211; I&#8217;m not sure how performance would be on Generation 1 and the Fire Sticks. Kodi version I&#8217;m using is 17.4</em></p>\n<p>With that out the way &#8211; this is a pretty lengthy guide, so grab some coffee.</p>\n<h2>Installation</h2>\n<p>For the purpose of this tutorial, I&#8217;ll assume that you already have Kodi installed on your Fire TV, if you don&#8217;t &#8211; you can follow the same method as described for installing RetroArch below.</p>\n<h3>Installing RetroArch</h3>\n<p>RetroArch is a cross platform, all in one emulator. You&#8217;ll need to <a href=\"http://buildbot.libretro.com/stable/1.6.7/android/\">download the latest APK file</a> and sideload it the Fire TV. As of writing this, 1.6.7 is the latest version, but if there&#8217;s a newer version available, use that instead.</p>\n<p>I personally always use adbfire to sideload. You can find an easy <a href=\"http://www.aftvnews.com/sideload-adbfire-windows/\">tutorial to do that over at AFTVNews</a>.</p>\n<h3>Installing Internet Archive ROM Launcher</h3>\n<p>This Kodi add-on does exactly what it says on the tin. It&#8217;s collated ROMs that were released onto <a href=\"https://archive.org\">The Internet Archive</a> and lets you browse games within Kodi and play them via the cloud.</p>\n<p>To install &#8211; you&#8217;ll need to <a href=\"https://github.com/zach-morris/plugin.program.iarl\">download zachmorris&#8217; repository zip</a> to your computer, you can then use the &#8216;File Manager&#8217; option in adbfire to push the .zip to your Fire TV.</p>\n<p>Once you&#8217;ve transferred the .zip to your Fire TV, you&#8217;ll install the add-on by: Kodi -&gt; Add-on Browser -&gt; Install from zip file.</p>\n<p>When zachmorris&#8217; repository is installed, you&#8217;ll then be able to install the IARL add-on by: Add-on Browser -&gt; Zach Morris&#8217; Add-ons -&gt; Video add-ons -&gt; Internet Archive Rom Launcher.</p>\n<p>It might seem a bit weird that it&#8217;s listed under &#8216;Video add-ons&#8217; &#8211; but this is just so the add-on has the option to use the cover-art focused ViewTypes in Kodi.</p>\n<h2>Configuration</h2>\n<p>Okay, so, two things should have happened now: the RetroArch app will be on your Fire TV homepage, and The Internet Archive ROM Launcher will be under &#8216;Add-ons&#8217; on Kodi. The endgame of this tutorial is that you&#8217;re going to be browsing the ROMs in Kodi, and have them automatically launch into RetroArch to play.</p>\n<h3>Configuring RetroArch</h3>\n<p>Before we begin, you need to know that RetroArch&#8217;s UI can be a confusing pain in the ass, especially when configuring it for the first time, but the app is very powerful.</p>\n<p>What you&#8217;ll want to do first is bind your controllers buttons to RetroArch. As RetroArch is multi-platform, the default button bindings can be a bit confusing, especially as RetroArch won&#8217;t know which controller you&#8217;re using. I&#8217;m using a no-name wireless controller from Amazon (it looks sort of like an Xbox 360 controller and works great).</p>\n<p>With your controller already paired up to your Fire TV, open up RetroArch -&gt; Settings -&gt; Input -&gt; Input User 1 Binds. By default, I think these are configured for a PC keyboard, so bind the keys to something comfortable for you to navigate the menus with.</p>\n<h3>Downloading Cores</h3>\n<p>RetroArch uses something called <a href=\"http://www.retroarch.com/index.php?page=cores\">cores</a> for each console that it emulates, and these cores must be downloaded individually on a per-console basis.</p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;RetroArch is a modular program that runs emulators and games within its framework as if they were &#8216;plugins&#8217;.<br />\nThese plugins are called &#8216;cores&#8217;, and you need to install them inside RetroArch to be able to use them.&#8221;</p></blockquote>\n<p>While still in RetroArch, navigate to Main Menu -&gt; Online Updater -&gt; Core Updater. Here, you&#8217;ll see a giant list of of consoles, most with something following it brackets:</p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_475\" style=\"width: 1024px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img class=\"size-large wp-image-475\" src=\"https://jonashcroft.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/102717215040-1024x576.png\" alt=\"List of RetroArch Cores\" width=\"1024\" height=\"576\" srcset=\"https://jonashcroft.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/102717215040-1024x576.png 1024w, https://jonashcroft.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/102717215040-300x169.png 300w, https://jonashcroft.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/102717215040-768x432.png 768w, https://jonashcroft.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/102717215040-992x558.png 992w, https://jonashcroft.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/102717215040-250x141.png 250w, https://jonashcroft.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/102717215040-480x270.png 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">List of RetroArch Cores</figcaption></figure>\n<p>These are all of the cores that are available. I don&#8217;t know if RetroArch configures this list based on the hosts&#8217; platform, so I&#8217;m not entirely sure if they&#8217;re all compatible for the Fire TV. Nevertheless, you&#8217;re going to want to download cores for the consoles you want. For this tutorial, we&#8217;ll do the SNES.</p>\n<p>You&#8217;ll notice that each console may have more than one core, different cores may perform better/worse than others, but I&#8217;d recommend only downloading one per console. For SNES, I use <strong>Snes9x 2010</strong> on the Fire TV, so click that. You&#8217;ll see the download status appear in the bottom left corner.</p>\n<h3>Configuring Cores</h3>\n<p>You&#8217;ll now have your first core! What you&#8217;re going to do next is configure your newly downloaded core, so hit &#8216;Back&#8217; until you&#8217;re at &#8216;Main Menu&#8217; again. This time, go into &#8216;Load Core&#8217;, locate &#8216;SNES / Super Famicon (Snes9x 2010)&#8217; and click it.</p>\n<p>Now, this is where RetroArch gets confusing: you&#8217;re no longer in the RetroArch &#8216;Main Menu&#8217;, you&#8217;re in the Snes9x &#8216;Core Menu&#8217;:</p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_477\" style=\"width: 1024px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img class=\"size-large wp-image-477\" src=\"https://jonashcroft.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/102717215621-1024x576.png\" alt=\"RetroArch SNES9x Core Menu\" width=\"1024\" height=\"576\" srcset=\"https://jonashcroft.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/102717215621-1024x576.png 1024w, https://jonashcroft.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/102717215621-300x169.png 300w, https://jonashcroft.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/102717215621-768x432.png 768w, https://jonashcroft.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/102717215621-992x558.png 992w, https://jonashcroft.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/102717215621-250x141.png 250w, https://jonashcroft.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/102717215621-480x270.png 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">Navigating RetroArch&#8217;s Snes9x Core Main Menu</figcaption></figure>\n<p>Notice how the bottom left of the screenshot has changed from &#8216;No Core&#8217; to &#8216;Snes9x 2010&#8217;? That&#8217;s how you know which menu you&#8217;re in, so any changes you make now will only affect the Snes9x 2010 menu. Let&#8217;s say you bind new input keys for the SNES (which we&#8217;re about to do) &#8211; the buttons you bind here won&#8217;t overwrite the input keys you set earlier for the Main Menu. The same goes for future consoles that you add.</p>\n<p>Next, navigate to Settings -&gt; Input -&gt; Input User 1 Binds and configure your games controller to match that of your emulated consoles controller. I found that it helped to open a picture of a SNES controller from Google and use that as a reference.</p>\n<p>While there are more configuration options you can set for everything else, I&#8217;m just using the default settings for everything currently, so hit &#8216;Back&#8217; until you&#8217;re back at the &#8216;Snes9x Main Menu&#8217; and &#8216;Quit RetroArch&#8217;.</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s worth noting that &#8211; you can also use RetroArch to display and load locally stored ROMs, but I&#8217;d prefer to keep media browsing central to Kodi, so we&#8217;re going to use Internet Archive ROM Launcher.</p>\n<h3>Configuring Internet Archive ROM Launcher</h3>\n<p>We&#8217;re at the halfway point now! I know you&#8217;re gonna want to just play some games, but we still have some more setting up to do. It&#8217;s worth it, <em>believe me</em>.</p>\n<p>Open up Kodi and navigate the keypad to the IARL add-on so that the UI has the icon in focus. Don&#8217;t open it, instead, press the &#8216;Menu&#8217; button on the Fire TV remote and select &#8216;Settings&#8217;.</p>\n<p>The Internet Archive ROM Launcher is a front-end for ROMs, it&#8217;ll categorise everything and display cover art, but it can&#8217;t emulate games, so we need to tell it to launch ROMs externally.</p>\n<p>In the add-on settings menu, head to &#8216;External Launchers&#8217; and click on &#8216;My System Type&#8217;  and select &#8216;Android&#8217;.</p>\n<p>As we&#8217;re running RetroArch on Android, we don&#8217;t have to enter values for &#8216;RetroArch System Folder&#8217; and &#8216;CFG&#8217; (config) &#8211; as the Internet Archive ROM Launcher will automatically populate these using the default locations later.</p>\n<p>Next, go down to &#8216;Setup Wizard&#8217; &#8211; for &#8216;Set me up for&#8217;, select &#8216;Balanced&#8217;. I haven&#8217;t tried the other options, but I figured that balanced performance should be a good default for most systems, you&#8217;re obviously welcome to try the others.</p>\n<h3>Configuring different consoles</h3>\n<p>Nearly there &#8211; I promise. Remember how in RetroArch we had to set up different configurations for each console? You&#8217;ve got to do something similar for IARL, whereby you need to tell each console to launch RetroArch with the correct core.</p>\n<p>Open up Internet Archive ROM Launcher, navigate to the SNES and press the &#8216;Menu&#8217; button to bring up the console&#8217;s sub menu:</p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_485\" style=\"width: 1024px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img class=\"size-large wp-image-485\" src=\"https://jonashcroft.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/102717225643-1024x576.png\" alt=\"Internet Archive ROM Launcher console settings\" width=\"1024\" height=\"576\" srcset=\"https://jonashcroft.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/102717225643-1024x576.png 1024w, https://jonashcroft.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/102717225643-300x169.png 300w, https://jonashcroft.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/102717225643-768x432.png 768w, https://jonashcroft.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/102717225643-992x558.png 992w, https://jonashcroft.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/102717225643-250x141.png 250w, https://jonashcroft.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/102717225643-480x270.png 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">Internet Archive ROM Launcher console settings submenu</figcaption></figure>\n<p>We&#8217;re going to be configuring the first three options from this submenu. First, click on &#8216;Update Download Path&#8217; and set this to &#8216;Default&#8217;. This is where ROMs will download/cache to when you play.</p>\n<p>Next, set &#8216;Update Launcher&#8217; to &#8216;External&#8217;.</p>\n<p>Finally, click on &#8216;Update Ext Launcher Command&#8217; &#8211; this is where we tell our External Launcher (RetroArch) to load the correct core for our console (Snes9X 2010). So open up this menu and it&#8217;ll bring up another list of cores.</p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_489\" style=\"width: 1024px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img class=\"size-large wp-image-489\" src=\"https://jonashcroft.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/102717230142-1024x576.png\" alt=\"External Launchers for Internet Archive Rom Launcher in Kodi\" width=\"1024\" height=\"576\" srcset=\"https://jonashcroft.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/102717230142-1024x576.png 1024w, https://jonashcroft.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/102717230142-300x169.png 300w, https://jonashcroft.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/102717230142-768x432.png 768w, https://jonashcroft.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/102717230142-992x558.png 992w, https://jonashcroft.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/102717230142-250x141.png 250w, https://jonashcroft.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/102717230142-480x270.png 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">List of External Launcher commands in Internet Archive ROM Launcher</figcaption></figure>\n<p>This list will display all available cores for all platforms, not just the Fire TV. Conveniently, the RetroArch ones are prefixed with RetroArch, so navigate to &#8216;RetroArch SNES9x 2010 (SNES)&#8217; and hit &#8216;Okay&#8217;.</p>\n<p>In a roundabout way, we&#8217;ve just told IARL: &#8220;When I select <strong>SNES</strong>, I want you to open <strong>RetroArch </strong>and use the <strong>Snes9X 2010 core.</strong>&#8221; This part needs to be all configured correctly, else your ROMs won&#8217;t launch.</p>\n<p>You&#8217;ll need to do this bit for each individual console that you&#8217;ve configured in RetroArch, it&#8217;s a bit tedious to do, but once you&#8217;ve set it up once, you can go straight into launching games every time.</p>\n<h2>Playing your games</h2>\n<p>You&#8217;ll <strong>finally</strong> be able to play games. The Internet Archive ROM Launcher has a huge collection of games &#8211; so navigating through lists may take some time.</p>\n<p>Some games require you to login to play, so I&#8217;d highly recommend registering at <a href=\"https://archive.org/\">archive.org</a> and entering your login details in the &#8216;Add-on Settings&#8217; menu. (Note that IARL stores your login data in plain-text, so use different login details to your usual).</p>\n<p>As an added quirk &#8211; RetroArch needs to not be running for Internet Archive ROM Launcher to launch games correctly. From the documentation:</p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;This is a limitation of the Retroarch command line in Android. To workaround this, I recommend setting up a hotkey / button combination to exit Retroarch when you exit a game &#8211; that way the next game you try will launch correctly.&#8221;</p></blockquote>\n<p>From now on, when you select a game, you&#8217;ll have the option to &#8216;Download&#8217; or &#8216;Launch&#8217; the game. In most scenarios, you&#8217;ll be fine with just &#8216;Launch&#8217;, as the ROM&#8217;ll be cached, though &#8216;Download&#8217; will obviously allow for quicker launch. When you &#8216;Launch&#8217; the game, it&#8217;ll open up RetroArch.</p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_492\" style=\"width: 1024px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img class=\"size-large wp-image-492\" src=\"https://jonashcroft.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/102717232623-1024x576.png\" alt=\"Super Mario All-Stars on Kodi Fire TV\" width=\"1024\" height=\"576\" srcset=\"https://jonashcroft.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/102717232623-1024x576.png 1024w, https://jonashcroft.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/102717232623-300x169.png 300w, https://jonashcroft.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/102717232623-768x432.png 768w, https://jonashcroft.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/102717232623-992x558.png 992w, https://jonashcroft.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/102717232623-250x141.png 250w, https://jonashcroft.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/102717232623-480x270.png 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">Super Mario All-Stars on Fire TV via RetroArch</figcaption></figure>\n<h2>Wrapping things up</h2>\n<p>You should now have emulation on your Fire TV! I know that the setup is incredibly tedious, but I think that the results are absolutely worth it. You just have to be patient and experiment with the different options. It&#8217;s not as intimidating as it looks, and you will get it working.</p>\n<p>You can use the same steps as above to emulate other consoles. I&#8217;d recommend Googling around to see what cores and configurations people are using and follow suite &#8211; or experiment! It might be good to use trial and error so that you can learn for yourself.</p>\n<p>So far, I&#8217;ve played SNES, PS1, and N64 on my Fire TV with excellent performance. The way I see it is that you only have to do the tedious part one time. Once you know how to set up RetroArch and Internet Archive ROM Launcher, I think that setting up a new consoles is relatively quick.</p>\n<p>If you&#8217;ve read through this whole post &#8211; thank you! It was a long read. Now go play some retro games, you deserve it.</p>\n",

      "slug": "what-is-it-like-to-use-a-hackintosh",
      "content": "<blockquote>\n<h2>hackintosh</h2>\n<p>/ˈhakɪntɒʃ/</p>\n<p><sub><em>noun</em></sub></p>\n<p><sub><em>&#8220;<b>Hackintosh</b> is a type of computer in which a non-Macintosh or unsupported computer is converted to run a Mac OS. <b>Hackintosh</b> is a portmanteau of the terms hacking and Macintosh.&#8221;</em></sub></p></blockquote>\n<p>At the end of 2015, I made the decision to treat myself to a new computer. My old Windows PC was on its last legs, and it was time. I wanted my next machine to be an Apple one. So, I decided to take the leap and do something I&#8217;ve always wanted to try: a hackintosh</p>\n<p>The concept of a hackintosh has always intrigued me, you take a &#8216;standard&#8217; PC build and install macOS on it. However, there are issues: macOS is designed to run on hardware combinations specifically chosen for the &#8216;Mac&#8217; line of products, part of Apple&#8217;s &#8216;It Just Works&#8217; mantra. All we&#8217;re essentially doing, is gathering similar hardware and tricking macOS into thinking that your computer is a legitimate Mac.</p>\n<p>Depending on your hardware combinations, this can either be incredibly easy, or incredibly hard. You can&#8217;t just take any old motherboard and expect that macOS will work flawlessly on it without having to modify anything. If that were the case, there wouldn&#8217;t be a need for &#8216;hackintosh&#8217; and macOS would be similar to Windows.</p>\n<p>So what&#8217;s it like? Does it break every other week? Is it just as good as a real Mac? Does it <strong>Just Work? </strong>I&#8217;ll try and provide some insight after having used mine as my primary machine for nearly a year-and-a-half.</p>\n<h2>Why not buy a real Mac?</h2>\n<p>A Combination of reasons. First and foremost: I couldn&#8217;t afford one. I wasn&#8217;t making enough money at the time of purchase to justify it, and Windows 10 had less than impressed me. My entire build came to around £400 or so with the hardware below:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Motherboard:</strong> ASRock Z97 Anniversary LGA 1150</li>\n<li><strong>CPU:</strong>  Intel Core i5-4440 CPU @ 3.10GHz</li>\n<li><strong>RAM: </strong>x2 Crucial 4GB DDR3L-1600</li>\n<li><strong>Graphics:</strong>  NVIDIA GeForce GTX 750 Ti (purchased a few weeks later)</li>\n<li><strong>WiFi: </strong>TP-LINK N900 (TL-WDN4800)</li>\n<li><strong>Bluetooth:</strong> Belkin F8T065 (USB Adaptor)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Not an incredible build by any means, but the budget was strict and performance is (still) excellent. Which leads me to my next point: The Touchbar Macbook Pro was an underpowered machine, and as of writing this, it&#8217;s been nearly <strong>2 years</strong> since the Mac Pro and iMac were last updated. I feel like this sort of leaves those who want the latest and greatest hardware with macOS at somewhat of a cross-road. Your choices are to either buy a 2 year old machine, or wait until the next one is released. It doesn&#8217;t leave you with much choice. I believe that hackintoshes give you more choice.</p>\n<h2>Is it as reliable as a real Mac?</h2>\n<p>For me personally, <strong>yes</strong>, a hackintosh is as reliable as a real Mac. But this is going to be an anecdotal response, your machines reliability will only be as reliable as the hardware you select. You&#8217;re going to want hardware that is as compatible with macOS as you possibly can. I&#8217;d recommend only buying hardware on <a href=\"https://www.tonymacx86.com/buyersguide/april/2017\">tonymacx86&#8217;s Buyers Guide</a> for your hackintosh. Once your machine is setup, it is 90% like using a real Mac. You can still download apps on the App Store, sign in to iCloud, sync with your iPhone etc. Business as usual.</p>\n<p>The other 10%? Something will go wrong at some point, and you have to be prepared to fix it. Full system updates can break things, audio could randomly flake out, or you could end up with a kernel panic:</p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_138\" style=\"width: 960px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-138\" src=\"https://jonashcroft.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/kernal-panic.jpg\" alt=\"Picture of a Kernal Panic on a Hackintosh\" width=\"960\" height=\"648\" srcset=\"https://jonashcroft.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/kernal-panic.jpg 960w, https://jonashcroft.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/kernal-panic-300x203.jpg 300w, https://jonashcroft.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/kernal-panic-768x518.jpg 768w, https://jonashcroft.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/kernal-panic-250x169.jpg 250w, https://jonashcroft.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/kernal-panic-480x324.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 960px) 100vw, 960px\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">Random Kernal Panic on my hackintosh</figcaption></figure>\n<p>As mentioned, higher hardware compatibility and correct system setup will minimise headaches. To put the errors in perspective &#8211; since the end of 2015, I have had 3 major system errors &#8211; 1) the kernal panic above 2) audio randomly broke 3) upgrading to Sierra broke a few things. 3 errors across almost 2 years is a pretty damn good success rate for a hackintosh if you ask me.</p>\n<p>That being said, be prepared to research like you&#8217;ve never researched before. Do as much research as you can and really soak in absolutely everything you can about how these run. Learn your hardware, be prepared to troubleshoot and problem solve. I have learned so much about the inner workings of macOS and appreciate all the small things that Apple have done to make things &#8216;Just Work&#8217;.</p>\n<h2>Should you build a hackintosh?</h2>\n<p>The initial setup process can be tricky, and you must not be afraid to mess around with your system and expect that things may not work right away. But that&#8217;s okay, there&#8217;s an abundance of guides out there, and communities as tonymacx86 and /r/hackintosh with people who are willing to help and have often used similar hardware &#8211; so you won&#8217;t be stranded when things go wrong.</p>\n<p>Using this machine day to day is genuinely no different to using the Mac at my workplace. If everything is setup right, you&#8217;ll forget that you&#8217;re running a hackintosh and just assume it&#8217;s a Mac, it can be that seamless.  The performance of the machine is incredibly comparable to that of a real Mac, and sometimes, they can perform <em>better</em> than real Macs. That being said, there are a few cons for me:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>As of writing this, iMessage still isn&#8217;t working</li>\n<li>Handoff / Airdrop isn&#8217;t guaranteed</li>\n<li>I&#8217;d like to be able to do a full system upgrade without hiccups</li>\n<li>It&#8217;s not as &#8216;pretty&#8217; as a real Mac.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>I&#8217;d only recommend hackintoshes for yourself if you&#8217;re comfortable playing with computer hardware and configurations. I&#8217;d build one for myself again, definitely, but I wouldn&#8217;t build one for my parents to keep at their house.</p>\n",

      "slug": "one-month-with-apple-watch",
      "content": "<p>At the end of March, I got an Apple Watch. So, I thought I&#8217;d write a little post about my thoughts on using it after one month.</p>\n<p>Smartwatches are never something that I thought I&#8217;d have. Not because I didn&#8217;t necessarily <em>want</em> one, but when it came to spending near £300 on something, I didn&#8217;t really want to commit to a device that I wasn&#8217;t entirely sure I would find a need for in my life. However, the opportunity presented itself &#8211; and now I&#8217;m in love.</p>\n<p>I was originally going to do this post a few weeks ago, entitled &#8216;a week with Apple Watch&#8217; &#8211; but I didn&#8217;t think that 7 days was enough to give perspective on something that would essentially be on my person nearly for every hour that I&#8217;m awake. I&#8217;m glad that I waited to write this post, because it took me a while to get used to wearing the Apple Watch, and I&#8217;ve been discovering more and more uses for it as the days go on.</p>\n<h2>The Hardware</h2>\n<p>The first day of having this, I wanted to put a case on it. It looks so, delicate, I was worried about destroying it. However, I&#8217;ve found it to be pretty durable. The amount of times I&#8217;ve accidentally knocked the watch, or bumped into things while walking and it still looks brand new.</p>\n<p>I&#8217;m aware it&#8217;s waterproof, but I&#8217;m still nervous to have it exposed to water. I&#8217;ve ran a few times in the rain with it and everything still works, but it&#8217;s still taking me a while to trust the waterproofness.</p>\n<h2>Fitness Tracking</h2>\n<p>Right off the bat. Most people I&#8217;ve spoken to who aren&#8217;t sure about the watch have said &#8216;I suppose it&#8217;s great for tracking fitness&#8217;, and it is. I don&#8217;t consider myself a health-nut, Apple clearly have taken steps to encourage good health with this device. The Watch tracks your calories, time moving, and standing hours in the built-in &#8216;Activity&#8217; app (those rings are incredibly addictive). This data then imports into the<em> Health</em> app on your phone &#8211; which lead me to discover that the <em>Health </em>app exists&#8230;</p>\n<p>I go running quite a bit, so I have the Series 2, Nike Edition. I can&#8217;t tell you how pleased I was to discover that I could leave my phone at home and just use the watch. I genuinely can&#8217;t imagine running with a bulky phone strapped to my arm again. It&#8217;s also so handy to look down and see my current stats at a glance.</p>\n<h2>Watch Faces</h2>\n<p>I love the Watch Faces. They&#8217;re relatively modular, where you can pick widgets (called &#8216;Complications&#8217; (?)) that always display on your watch face:</p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_363\" style=\"width: 750px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-363\" src=\"https://jonashcroft.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/IMG_2216.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"750\" height=\"447\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">My current Apple Watch face</figcaption></figure>\n<p>On the top left, I have my Activity Rings; top right: next Calendar event; bottom left: Current Moon Phase; bottom right, current weather. If I tap any of them, it shows me more information. I also like that you can have multiple faces at one. If I were to swipe left, I can switch to a different face. I&#8217;ve found that it&#8217;s incredibly useful having different faces for different scenarios &#8211; one for home, work, when travelling, etc.</p>\n<p>I do wish that there were more customisations for the faces. You&#8217;re limited to the ones that Apple supply, and while you can customise them all to an extent, if watch faces were opened up to third party developers, I really think we&#8217;d see this functionality thrive. But, we all know that visual customisation isn&#8217;t open of Apple&#8217;s selling points.</p>\n<h2>Transport Assistance</h2>\n<p>Working in the city, I&#8217;m on the train or bus every single day. <a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/citymapper-the-ultimate-transit-app/id469463298?mt=8\">Citymapper</a> has been excellent for bus route tracking and information. Having routes and times at a glance has been indispensable.</p>\n<p>While <a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/trainline-uk-live-train-times-tickets-planner/id334235181?mt=8\">Trainline</a>&#8216;s iPhone app is absolutely gorgeous &#8211; their watch app leaves much to be desired. I was hoping to be able to keep my &#8216;Favourite&#8217; routes on the watch and instantly get service update notifications, platform information etc.. but you have to manually search a route on your phone first before you can do anything on the Watch. Even then, it only tells you where the train currently is geographically. No notifications or anything (such a first-world problem, I know). By the looks of it, the National Rail watch app may do all these things. It&#8217;s a shame their iPhone app is ugly!</p>\n<p>Uber was a nice addition, too. The app is incredibly basic, in a good way. I can request a journey on my phone, and then the watch will display journey information: driver name, car, rating, current car location etc. It&#8217;ll even alert me when the driver is outside. How many times have you been waiting for your Uber to arrive and feel like you constantly need to check the app on your phone? It&#8217;s great to be able to get on with things.</p>\n<p>I was incredibly disappointed with Google Maps. Which I understand, why would Google make a great map app for Apple Watch when they want people to buy an Android Wear device? I think I had high expectations because Google sometimes have a habit of making their iPhone apps better than their Android counterparts. That being said, the Google Maps app simply displayed turn-by-turn directions in a list on your watch, and then they completely pulled the app. Oh, okay.</p>\n<h2>Siri is&#8230; okay</h2>\n<p>I&#8217;d never even activated Siri on my phone before I got the watch. My previous phone was a Nexus 5X, and I knew that going from Google&#8217;s assistant to Siri would be disappointing, and I was right. Siri is still absolutely useless. Somehow, Siri is even more chained down on the watch than she is on the phone. Siri on the watch is only in hands-free mode when the screen is face-up and the screen is on, which is great for the battery and my tinfoil hat. It&#8217;s just a shame that whenever I ask her to do anything, she either responds in text-format (yup), or tells me that she &#8216;can&#8217;t do that&#8217;.</p>\n<p>Still, it&#8217;s a great tool for voice reminders, which I do actually use all the time.</p>\n<h2>Overall</h2>\n<p>I could go on, there are way more things the watch does that I haven&#8217;t mentioned, tried yet, or maybe even discovered. While the watch does show it&#8217;s limitations at points, it&#8217;s a great bridging device between my phone and my real-life. It&#8217;s nice to not have to feel I have to look down on my screen for information and I can just get on with things.</p>\n<p>While I can recognise its flaws, I can also appreciate that it&#8217;s a pretty damn good assistant to my life, and I do love it.</p>\n",

      "content": "<p>For the first time since its initial setup, I decided that it was time to take the plunge and upgrade my hackintosh to Sierra. I&#8217;m not gonna lie, it&#8217;s something that I&#8217;ve been putting off doing for a long time. This is my primary machine, so if something went wrong, I didn&#8217;t want to take the risk of being out of action for a while.</p>\n<p>It turns out, upgrading from Yosemite to Sierra was a lot easier than I expected. In this post, I&#8217;ll write an overview of what I did, tips, and fixes for my specific hardware.</p>\n<h2>System Specs:</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Motherboard:</strong> ASRock Z97 Anniversary LGA 1150</li>\n<li><strong>CPU:</strong>  Intel Core i5-4440 CPU @ 3.10GHz</li>\n<li><strong>RAM: </strong>x2 Crucial 4GB DDR3L-1600</li>\n<li><strong>Graphics:</strong>  NVIDIA GeForce GTX 750 Ti</li>\n<li><strong>WiFi: </strong>TP-LINK N900 (TL-WDN4800)</li>\n<li><strong>Bluetooth:</strong> Belkin F8T065 (USB Adaptor)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The build is mostly based around hardware on tonymacx86&#8217;s buyers guide (I can&#8217;t remember the specific month/year). The closer you are to genuine Apple Mac hardware in your build, the less headaches you&#8217;re going to have.</p>\n<h2>Pre-installation</h2>\n<p>The upgrade process was literally as <a href=\"https://www.tonymacx86.com/threads/unibeast-install-macos-sierra-on-any-supported-intel-based-pc.200564/\">straight forward as described in this post</a>. My previous build was with Chimera/Chameleon bootloader, and migrating to Clover wasn&#8217;t as daunting as I anticipated.</p>\n<h3>Motherboard Settings:</h3>\n<p>The Z97 is a wonderful board to use for a hackintosh, I changed the boot mode to UEFI (not Legacy) and configured the settings below:</p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><strong>Advanced / Chipset Configuration:</strong><br />\nPrimary Graphics Adapter = PCI Express<br />\nVT-d = Disabled<br />\nIGPU = Disabled</p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><strong>Advanced / CPU Configuration [CPU PM (native XCPM mode) &amp; flawless Sleep and Wake]:</strong><br />\nCPU C States Support = Enabled<br />\nEnhanced Halt Support (C1E) = Enabled<br />\nCPU C3 State Support = Disabled<br />\nCPU C6 State Support = Auto<br />\nCPU C7 State Support = Auto<br />\nPackage C State Support = C6<br />\nAdvanced / Storage Configuration:<br />\nSATA Controller(s) = Enabled<br />\nSATA Mode Selection = AHCI</p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><strong>Advanced:<br />\n</strong>Intel Rapid Start Technology = Disabled<br />\nIntel Smart Connect Technology = Disabled<br />\nAdvanced / ACPI Configuration:<br />\nSuspend to RAM = Auto<br />\nCheck Ready Bit = Enabled<br />\nACPI HPET Table = Enabled<br />\nRTC Alarm Power On = By OS (this setting doesn&#8217;t cause system waking on every 2 hours!)<br />\nUSB Keyboard / Remote Power On = Enabled<br />\nUSB Mouse Power On = Enabled<br />\nAdvanced / USB Configuration:<br />\nUSB Controller = Enabled<br />\nIntel USB3.0 Mode = Smart Auto<br />\nLegacy USB Support = Enabled<br />\nLegacy USB3.0 Support = Enabled<br />\nUSB Compatibility Patch = Disabled</p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><strong>Boot:<br />\n</strong>CSM (Compatibility Support Module) = Disabled</p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><strong>Security:<br />\n</strong>Secure Boot = Disabled</p>\n<h2>Post Installation</h2>\n<h3>ASRock Motherboard not booting</h3>\n<p>This was by far the most frustrating issue. With Yosemite, my motherboard was booting in Legacy mode, and I&#8217;d read that things are generally better when booting from the UEFI instead. So I decided to go with that! Unfortunately, there is a quirk with ASRock&#8217;s UEFI implementation, which leads to <strong>the motherboard not booting at all in UEFI mode</strong>. My system returned the dreaded boot0 error.</p>\n<p>I was able to boot from USB into Clover, then start the hard drive from there, but that&#8217;s no good. After intense Googling, I found that the best method is to <a href=\"https://www.tonymacx86.com/threads/guide-asrock-uefi-boot-fix.174726/\">install a Linux Live installation to USB</a>, and use Linux to install the necessary kernel modules to the motherboard. Great! Install Linux to USB, run sudo apt-get, and reboot. Sounds easy enough!</p>\n<p>Wrong. It didn&#8217;t work.</p>\n<p>I have no idea why, and at the time, I was too frustrated to keep attempting &#8211; the USB simply wouldn&#8217;t boot into Linux, no matter what distro I tried. It was <em>especially</em> annoying seeing people comment it worked for them. A little disheartened at this point; I decided to search for alternative methods, and after some even more intense Googling, I came across an Insanely Mac post from 2014, where a fantastic specimen of a man had posted an <a href=\"http://www.insanelymac.com/forum/topic/302041-guide-asrock-h97-pro4-yosemite-with-clover-uefi-installation/\">alternative method to add Clover to the UEFI boot menu</a>. The method is:</p>\n<h3>Add Clover to UEFI boot menu:</h3>\n<ol>\n<li>Restart the system and boot into the clover USB drive</li>\n<li>Navigate to UEFI Shell 64 (aka command line)</li>\n<li>Run these commands: (I&#8217;ve left the original comments in)</li>\n</ol>\n<pre><code class=\"language-command\">Shell&gt; map fs* # Show all partitions\r\nShell&gt; fs0: (or fs1: or fs2: ...) # Switch to fs0, fs1, fs2,... partitions\r\nShell&gt; ls # List the contents of current partition / directory\r\nShell&gt; cd \\efi\\boot # Change the directory to \\efi\\boot\r\nShell&gt; ls\r\n</code></pre>\n<p>All we&#8217;re doing here is directory browsing so we can locate <strong>bootx64.efi</strong>, which is fallback program for when the EFI hasn&#8217;t been configured with any boot entries. In the next step, (surprise!) we add bootx64.efi to our main hard drive.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-command\">Shell&gt; help bcfg -b -v # Get help on bcfg command \r\nShell&gt; bcfg boot dump # List current boot options\r\nShell&gt; bcfg boot add N bootx64.efi \"Clover\" # Add bootx64.efi from the current dir (\\efi\\boot) as a boot option labeled \"Clover\" (You will see this name also in the UEFI BIOS Boot menu boot items). N is the boot option number: 0 if you want it to be the first, 1 to be the second, etc.\r\nShell&gt; bcfg boot dump # Check if Clover is added\r\nShell&gt; reset # Restart the system and load Clover from SSD / HDD\r\n</code></pre>\n<p>It took me a few attempts to find the correct partition on my hard drive, I think it ended up being fs1. But regardless, the solution was very simple, and on reboot, it worked!</p>\n<p>rednous, I don&#8217;t know who you are. But if i ever meet you, I&#8217;m buying you a beer.</p>\n<h3>Multibeast Settings:</h3>\n<p>As mentioned, this motherboard is very good at natively working within macOS. Main things here: I was advised to set the system definition to iMac 14,2, and to to install Clover to UEFI boot mode (we still have to do the above, because of the buggy UEFI).</p>\n<p>Audio didn&#8217;t work from get-go, which was expected. After a few attempts, I found that ALC887/888b worked very well.</p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_323\" style=\"width: 913px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img class=\"wp-image-323 size-full\" src=\"https://jonashcroft.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Screen-Shot-2017-04-30-at-19.15.18.png\" alt=\"Multibeast settings for my Hackintosh coniguration\" width=\"913\" height=\"741\" srcset=\"https://jonashcroft.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Screen-Shot-2017-04-30-at-19.15.18.png 913w, https://jonashcroft.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Screen-Shot-2017-04-30-at-19.15.18-300x243.png 300w, https://jonashcroft.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Screen-Shot-2017-04-30-at-19.15.18-768x623.png 768w, https://jonashcroft.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Screen-Shot-2017-04-30-at-19.15.18-250x203.png 250w, https://jonashcroft.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Screen-Shot-2017-04-30-at-19.15.18-480x390.png 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 913px) 100vw, 913px\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">Multibeast settings for my Hackintosh configuration</figcaption></figure>\n<p>It&#8217;s important as well, to <strong>NOT</strong> inject nVidia, like I did. If you Inject nVidia, the Graphics Card won&#8217;t work. Luckily, because I had two monitors plugged in, the second not getting any signal was an immediate indication of anerror. Also, is that if you go to &#8216;About This Mac&#8217; &#8211; the memory on the Graphics card will show as 0mb.</p>\n<h3>nVidia Web Drivers</h3>\n<p>Incredibly straight forward, navigate to nVidia&#8217;s website and download the alternative <a href=\"https://images.nvidia.com/mac/pkg/367/WebDriver-367.15.10.35f01.pkg\">Graphics Card drivers for Sierra</a>. Install the software, and set your Hack to use nVidia drivers instead of native.</p>\n<h3>Fix no audio after sleep</h3>\n<p>A fun little quirk that I accidentally discovered, the audio kept disappearing any time the hackintosh woke up. I recall reading that this is a power management thing. Something about motherboard not sending a signal to the audio driver to power back on (don&#8217;t quote me here). Regardless &#8211; this is another pretty simple fix:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.tonymacx86.com/attachments/codeccommander-kext-zip.122335/\">Download CodecCommander.kext</a></li>\n<li>Unzip and install the kext to iMac/{Name of Disc}/System/Library/Extensions</li>\n<li>Reboot</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Important to note here, you do not install this kext to the EFI partition, you install it to the system. I think this is another power management thing (again, don&#8217;t quote me. I&#8217;m writing all this from memory and a few notes). The S/L/E directory will be a hidden directory, so make sure you&#8217;ve enabled hidden folders in Finder.</p>\n<p>If you experience an error message when you copy the kext to your Extensions folder, you need to repair system ownership. Open up Terminal and run this command:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-bash\">sudo chown -R root:wheel /System/Library/Extensions/CodecCommander.kext\r\n</code></pre>\n<h3>Getting iMessage to work</h3>\n<p>One of the initial reasons for me wanting to upgrade to Sierra &#8211; iMessage! Probably the most common issue I read about with hackintosh. Unfortunately, I still haven&#8217;t got mine to work. Following <a href=\"https://www.tonymacx86.com/threads/an-idiots-guide-to-imessage.196827/\">An iDiots Guide to iMessage</a> is a brilliant resource for getting to iMessage to work. I followed it, and I have reason to believe all of my settings are correct, but I&#8217;m faced with the &#8216;Contact Apple Support&#8217; message:</p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_330\" style=\"width: 612px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img class=\"wp-image-330 size-full\" src=\"https://jonashcroft.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/imageedit_7_2041633155.png\" alt=\"iMessage, Customer Code error\" width=\"612\" height=\"630\" srcset=\"https://jonashcroft.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/imageedit_7_2041633155.png 612w, https://jonashcroft.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/imageedit_7_2041633155-291x300.png 291w, https://jonashcroft.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/imageedit_7_2041633155-250x257.png 250w, https://jonashcroft.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/imageedit_7_2041633155-466x480.png 466w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 612px) 100vw, 612px\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">iMessage Customer Code error</figcaption></figure>\n<p>From what I gather, if you get the &#8216;Contact Apple Support&#8217; error code with iMessage &#8211; it means you&#8217;re good to go with the system configuration &#8211; incorrect serial number combinations tend to return a &#8216;Verification&#8217; error. Whereas this error message is a security measure by Apple to prevent IDs that appear fraudulent (think Russian, Chinese scammers). It&#8217;s easy for those with hackintosh&#8217;s to fall under this category, because part of the process of setting up iMessage is rotating your serial numbers to find a genuine match.</p>\n<p>The information in <a href=\"https://www.tonymacx86.com/threads/how-to-fix-imessage.110471/#TOP8\">this incredibly useful thread</a> gave me a much more clearer understanding of the error message. Though I have read conflicting reports, the information provided does make sense (especially in regards to the next section of this post).</p>\n<p>My options here I guess, are to wait it out and see if iMessage works in a few weeks time, or call Apple Support and see if they can remove the blacklist.</p>\n<h3>Removing old Mac from Apple iCloud</h3>\n<p>After trying to configure iMessage, and learning about the device quota, I had a look on iCloud to see what devices I was signed into. Lo-and-behold, my Yosemite build was still there (defined as a Mac Pro). It was right there next to my Sierra build (defined as iMac 27&#8243;). I didn&#8217;t have a screenshot of them both there, annoyingly.</p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_332\" style=\"width: 423px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-332\" src=\"https://jonashcroft.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/IMG_2211.png\" alt=\"My old Hackintosh build appearing in iCloud Devices\" width=\"423\" height=\"325\" srcset=\"https://jonashcroft.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/IMG_2211.png 423w, https://jonashcroft.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/IMG_2211-300x230.png 300w, https://jonashcroft.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/IMG_2211-250x192.png 250w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 423px) 100vw, 423px\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">My old Hackintosh build appearing in iCloud Devices</figcaption></figure>\n<p>So what was happening here? Despite them physically being the same machine, they&#8217;re treated as two separate machines on iCloud because when I did a fresh install from Yosemite to Sierra, I assigned new serial numbers and System Definitions to the machine.</p>\n<p>In any normal scenario, I should be able to select the device on my iCloud, and &#8216;Remove&#8217;. This didn&#8217;t work. This was the second most irritating issue in this post. No matter what I did, the device would not delete. I tried from my iPhone, I tried from iCloud.com, I tried from appleid.apple.com. Nothing. Would. Work. It just kept reappearing when I reloaded the page.</p>\n<p>The solution is a bit of a pain in the ass, but relatively simple</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Open up your favourite software for editing your config.plist. I used Clover Configurator.</li>\n<li>Make a note of your current, working Serial Number, UUID, Board Serial etc.</li>\n<li>Change your current serial number to your old builds serial number, reboot.</li>\n<li>Check that the serial number has changed</li>\n<li>Sign into iCloud on the Mac (may not be necessary, but I had to do this to let iCloud know the machine&#8217;s active)</li>\n<li>Sign into iCloud.com, remove the Mac from Device List</li>\n<li>Log into appleid.apple.com to verify the machine has been removed</li>\n<li>Sign out of iCloud on the Mac, and clear your caches by opening Terminal and entering the commands below</li>\n<li>Reboot</li>\n<li>Open up Clover Configurator and change your Serial Number back to your working one</li>\n</ol>\n<pre><code class=\"language-bash\">cd ~/Library/Caches/\r\nrm -R com.apple.Messages*\r\nrm -R com.apple.imfoundation*\r\ncd ~/Library/Preferences/\r\nrm com.apple.iChat*\r\nrm com.apple.imagent*\r\nrm com.apple.imessage*\r\nrm com.apple.imservice*\r\nrm -R ~/Library/Messages/</code></pre>\n<p>If all is well, your old build will disappear, and your Sierra build will now appear as the only device:</p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_338\" style=\"width: 524px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-338\" src=\"https://jonashcroft.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Screen-Shot-2017-04-30-at-02.53.23.png\" alt=\"List of devices on my Apple ID\" width=\"524\" height=\"266\" srcset=\"https://jonashcroft.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Screen-Shot-2017-04-30-at-02.53.23.png 524w, https://jonashcroft.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Screen-Shot-2017-04-30-at-02.53.23-300x152.png 300w, https://jonashcroft.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Screen-Shot-2017-04-30-at-02.53.23-250x127.png 250w, https://jonashcroft.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Screen-Shot-2017-04-30-at-02.53.23-480x244.png 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 524px) 100vw, 524px\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">My updated Sierra build showing correctly on Apple ID</figcaption></figure>\n<p>I don&#8217;t think that changing my serial number again has helped my chances of getting iMessage to work, but time will tell for that one.</p>\n<p>In hindsight, I definitely should have signed out of iCloud on Yosemite before doing a fresh install of Sierra. Next time, I&#8217;ll also take note of my current working Serial Number and transfer that one to the next upgrade.</p>\n<h2>Final thoughts</h2>\n<p>All in all, the process was relatively smooth. I feel a bit silly for worrying that everything would crash and burn. I definitely prefer Clover to Chimera/Chameleon &#8211; boot time is much faster, performance is smoother, and overall, the system is much more stable than it previously was. I also have to give a massive, massive thank you to the Hackintosh community over at tonymacx86 and /r/hackintosh. There are some tremendous resources out there, so it&#8217;s comforting to know that you&#8217;re not stranded when it comes to things breaking on hackintoshes.</p>\n<p>Here&#8217;s hoping that the next major update to macOS is smooth for the hackintosh.</p>\n",

You can easily bulk import users into WordPress with the following command:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-bash\">wp user import-csv --skip-update file-name.csv</code></pre>\n<p>The fantastic thing is that if you&#8217;ve added custom fields for your users, the import-csv function supports this right out of the box:</p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-286\" src=\"https://jonashcroft.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Screen-Shot-2017-03-23-at-10.49.07-PM.png\" alt=\"Example of a CSV file of users\" width=\"795\" height=\"313\" srcset=\"https://jonashcroft.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Screen-Shot-2017-03-23-at-10.49.07-PM.png 795w, https://jonashcroft.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Screen-Shot-2017-03-23-at-10.49.07-PM-300x118.png 300w, https://jonashcroft.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Screen-Shot-2017-03-23-at-10.49.07-PM-768x302.png 768w, https://jonashcroft.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Screen-Shot-2017-03-23-at-10.49.07-PM-250x98.png 250w, https://jonashcroft.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Screen-Shot-2017-03-23-at-10.49.07-PM-480x189.png 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 795px) 100vw, 795px\" /></p>\n<p>Your spreadsheet should look something like the above, with your standard WordPress fields as the headers.

The output on the terminal will also notify you of users who have failed to import.</p>\n<p>If you&#8217;re not using <a href=\"http://wp-cli.org/\">WP-CLI</a>, I <strong>highly </strong>recommend it. In this instance, the import process took a fraction of the time than it would have when using an import plugin, without the extra bloat.</p>\n",

The city itself is so vibrant, full of atmosphere, culture and identity, something that I think my hometown Birmingham is lacking, but slowly headed towards.</p>\n<p>Our stay was from Friday to Sunday, which gave us plenty of time to explore the city and actually <em>experience</em> it, rather than a flying visit where you struggle to cram everything into one day. I must admit, I was a bit worried at first &#8211; there aren&#8217;t exactly many &#8216;touristy&#8217; things to do in central Manchester outside of museums and some landmark buildings (please correct me if I&#8217;m wrong)!</p>\n<p>That being said, we did pay a visit to the fantastic Manchester Art Gallery &#8211; which hosted a &#8216;Modern Japanese Design&#8217; exhibition, featuring some unique furniture designs, as well as many classic COMME des GARÇONS and Yohji Yamamoto clothing items. I also especially loved the <a href=\"http://manchesterartgallery.org/exhibitions-and-events/exhibition/strange-and-familiar/\">Strange and Familiar: Britain as Revealed by International Photographers</a> exhibition &#8211; an intriguing eye opener into the identity of Britain.</p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_220\" style=\"width: 1024px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img class=\"size-large wp-image-220\" src=\"https://jonashcroft.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/IMG_0907-1024x768.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"768\" srcset=\"https://jonashcroft.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/IMG_0907-1024x768.jpg 1024w, https://jonashcroft.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/IMG_0907-300x225.jpg 300w, https://jonashcroft.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/IMG_0907-768x576.jpg 768w, https://jonashcroft.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/IMG_0907-992x744.jpg 992w, https://jonashcroft.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/IMG_0907-250x188.jpg 250w, https://jonashcroft.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/IMG_0907-480x360.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">Photography Feature Wall at Manchester Art Gallery</figcaption></figure>\n<p>I feel as though I should definitely mention how architecturally beautiful the John Rylands Library is &#8211; it&#8217;s worth a visit if you&#8217;re ever in Manchester, the place is literally (and I hate to use this comparison) like Hogwarts &#8211; filled with intimate hallways, a vast array of historical books, and a grand stunning hall (is it a hall?) where they supply you a mirror to look up at the roof, just in case your neck is sore.</p>\n<p>In terms of food and drink &#8211; Manchester really, <em>really</em> thrives here! We enjoyed Thai at <a href=\"http://mythairestaurant.co.uk/\">My Thai</a>, Indian Street Food at <a href=\"http://www.bundobust.com/\">Bundobust</a>, Burgers and wings at <a href=\"http://walrusmanchester.com/\">Walrus</a>, as well as brunch at <a href=\"https://www.figandsparrow.co.uk/\">Fig &amp; Sparrow</a>, a speciality coffee shop in the Northern Quarter, which I wholeheartedly recommend.</p>\n<p>I do wish that Birmingham had more of these independent, or small-chain, places to grab a bite to eat or drink &#8211; don&#8217;t get me wrong, the ones we do have are great, but we could always do with more.</p>\n<p>Which leads me to the Northern Quarter. Our hotel was actually on the south border of the Northern Quarter, so we were able to quickly make our way there and explore. the Northern Quarter is what I think Digbeth should strive to be.  It&#8217;s overflowing with amazing street art, a variance of independent stores and eateries, and it actually has foot-traffic. It felt like there was an actual presence of culture there; one I can only dream of for Digbeth. Maybe we&#8217;ll have that one day.</p>\n<p>Our visit here has reinforced to me just how important our local independent stores are, and that we need to support them in any way that we can. It&#8217;s safe to say that this year, I will be searching for more in Birmingham, and hopefully discovering more in new cities in the UK.</p>\n<p>Overall &#8211; Manchester was pretty awesome. Great art, great food, great shops, and most of all &#8211; great company. I can&#8217;t wait to go back.</p>\n",

      "slug": "how-to-start-and-stop-mamp-server-from-terminal",
      "content": "<p>I&#8217;m always looking for more ways to streamline my development process, and recently I&#8217;ve found myself getting mildly annoyed with having to launch the MAMP GUI anytime I wanted to begin building &#8211; so why not stop &amp; start the servers via Terminal?</p>\n<p>Turns out, this can easily be done by creating an alias in <code>.bash_profile</code> , so I thought I&#8217;d share with the world how to do it!</p>\n<p><strong>Step 1:</strong><br />\nLaunch <strong>Terminal</strong> from the <strong>/Applications/</strong><b>Utilities</b> folder.</p>\n<p><strong>Step 2:<br />\n</strong>We then need to navigate to our home directory. Type the following into Terminal and press enter:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-bash\">cd</code></pre>\n<h5>Step 3:</h5>\n<p>Open your .bash_profile</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-bash\">nano .bash_profile</code></pre>\n<p>If you don&#8217;t already have a .bash_profile, this command will create one &#8211; if .bash_profile <em>does</em> exist, then it will simply open the existing file in Terminals text editor &#8211; Nano.</p>\n<p><strong>Step 3:</strong><br />\nYou can now start editing your file, so drop this in there:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-bash\">alias startm='cd /Applications/MAMP/bin &amp;&amp; ./start.sh'\r\nalias stopm='cd /Applications/MAMP/bin &amp;&amp; ./stop.sh'</code></pre>\n<p><strong>Step 4:<br />\n</strong>Save your changes by pressing <strong>ctrl+o</strong> and hitting <strong>enter, </strong>then<strong> </strong>exit Nano by pressing <strong>ctrl+x</strong>.</p>\n<p><strong>Step 5:<br />\n</strong>Finally, we need to &#8216;activate&#8217; our changes, enter:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-bash\">source ~/.bash_profile</code></pre>\n<p>&#8230;and that&#8217;s it! Now, whenever you enter <code>startm</code> into the Terminal, MAMP will turn its servers on, while <code>stopm</code> will turn them off.</p>\n<p><strong>What&#8217;s happening here?</strong><br />\nThe alias issues two commands: <code>cd /Applications/MAMP/bin</code> tells Terminal to change directory into the MAMP app&#8217;s &#8216;bin&#8217; folder, which contain shell scripts that MAMP uses to initialise its services. The two scripts we want to run are <strong>start.sh</strong> &amp; <strong>stop.sh</strong>.</p>\n<p>We&#8217;ll then tell Terminal to run <strong>start.sh</strong> by adding <code>&amp;&amp; ./start.sh</code>.  &#8211; the double ampersands are to ensure thatÂ the next command will execute only if the previous command was successful.</p>\n<p><strong>Going the extra mile<br />\n</strong>I decided to take this one step further by including an alias that will open the MAMP app in a minimised state, as well as adding <a href=\"https://github.com/julienXX/terminal-notifier\">Terminal Notifier</a> into the mix, which will display a native system notification when each command has been successfully executed.</p>\n<p>See below:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-bash\">alias openmamp='open -j /Applications/MAMP/MAMP.app/ &amp;&amp; terminal-notifier -title \"Terminal\" -message \"MAMP Opened\"'\r\nalias startm='cd /Applications/MAMP/bin &amp;&amp; ./start.sh &amp;&amp; terminal-notifier -title \"Terminal\" -message \"MAMP Servers Started\"'\r\nalias stopm='cd /Applications/MAMP/bin &amp;&amp; ./stop.sh &amp;&amp; terminal-notifier -title \"Terminal\" -message \"MAMP Servers Stopped\"'</code></pre>\n<p>I hope you guys found this useful!</p>\n",
